### Energy burden
Energy burden and average annual energy costs are from the [US Department of Energy's LEAD Tool](https://www.energy.gov/scep/slsc/lead-tool).* **Energy burden** is defined through [DoE LEAD Tool methodology](https://lead.openei.org/docs/LEAD-Tool-Methodology.pdf) as the average annual housing energy costs divided by the average annual household income. It is shown as a percent (%) of household income and ranges from 1 - 15%. **Average annual housing energy costs** are based on household monthly expenditures for electricity, gas (utility and bottled), and other fuels (including fuel oil, wood, etc.). The variable is shown in US dollars ($). 

### Disadvantaged Community status
The Disadvantaged Community status variable is from the [Climate and Economic Justice (CEJST) Screening Tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5). The CEJST Screening Tool was developed by the US Digital Service in partnership with the White House Council on Environmental Quality and released in 2022. The CEJST Tool highlights disadvantaged census tracts across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Communities are considered disadvantaged: 1) If they are in census tracts that meet the thresholds for at least one of the toolâ€™s categories of burden, or 2) If they are on land within the boundaries of Federally Recognized Tribes.
